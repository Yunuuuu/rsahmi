\usage{
taxa_counts(umi_list, samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{umi_list}{A list of polars \link[polars:DataFrame_class]{DataFrame} for UMI
data returned by \link{kuactor}.}

\item{samples}{A character of sample identifier for each element in
\code{umi_list}.}
}
\value{
A polars \link[polars:DataFrame_class]{DataFrame}.
}
\description{
After identifying true taxa, reads assigned to those taxa are
extracted and then undergo a series of filters. The cell barcode and UMI are
used to demultiplex the reads and create a barcode x taxa counts matrix. The
full taxonomic classification of all resulting barcodes and the number of
counts assigned to each clade are tabulated.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# `umi_list` should be the output of all samples from `kuactor()`, and
# filtered by `slsd()` and `blsd()`
taxa_counts(umi_list, basename(names(umi_list)))
}
