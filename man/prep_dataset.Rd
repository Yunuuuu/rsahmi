\arguments{
\item{fa1, fa2}{The path to microbiome fasta 1 and 2 file (returned by
\link{extract_kraken_reads}).}

\item{kraken_report}{The path to kraken report file.}

\item{kraken_out}{The path of microbiome output file. Usually should be
filtered with \link{extract_kraken_output}.}

\item{cb_and_umi}{A function takes sequence id, read1, read2 and return a
list of 2 corresponding to cell barcode and UMI respectively., each should
have the same length of the input.}

\item{ranks}{Taxa ranks to analyze.}

\item{kmer_len}{Kraken kmer length. Default: \code{35L}, which is the default kmer
size of kraken2.}

\item{min_frac}{Minimum fraction of kmers directly assigned to taxid to use
read. Reads with \verb{<=min_frac} of the k-mers map inside the taxon's lineage
are also discarded.}

\item{exclude}{A character of taxid to exclude, for \code{SAHMI}, the host taxid.
Reads with any k-mers mapped to the \code{exclude} are discarded.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads to use.}

\item{overwrite}{A bool indicates whether to overwrite the files in \code{odir}.}

\item{odir}{A string of directory to save the results.}

\item{dir}{A string of directory containing the files returned by
\code{prep_dataset}.}
}
\description{
Three elements returned by this function:
\itemize{
\item \code{kreport}: Used by \link{slsd}.
\item \code{kmer}: Used by \link{blsd}. The function count the number of k-mers and unique
k-mers assigned to a taxon across barcodes. The cell barcode and
unique molecular identifier (UMI) are used to identify unique barcodes
and reads.  Data is reported for taxa of pre-specified ranks (default
genus + species) taking into account all subsequently higher
resolution ranks. The output is a table of barcodes, taxonomic IDs,
number of k-mers, and number of unique k-mers.
\item \code{umi}: Used by \link{taxa_counts}.

# for sequence from umi-tools, we can use following function
cb_and_umi <- function(sequence_id, read1, read2) {
    out <- lapply(
        strsplit(sequence_id, "_", fixed = TRUE),
        `[`, 2:3
    )
    lapply(1:2, function(i) {
        vapply(out, function(o) as.character(.subset2(o, i)), character(1L))
    })
