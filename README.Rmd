> **⚠️ This package has been superseded by [`scmire`](https://github.com/WangLabCSU/scmire).**  
> While `rsahmi` remains available for archival purposes, future development and improvements will be focused on `scmire`, which offers an improved design for single-cell microbiome reconstruction and quantification.

A computational resource designed to accurately detect microbial nucleic acids
while filtering out contaminants and false-positive taxonomic assignments from
standard transcriptomic sequencing of mammalian tissues (See
[SAHMI](https://github.com/sjdlabgroup/SAHMI)). This implementation leverages
the `rust` for fast and systematic microbial signal recovery and denoising from
host tissue genomic sequencing.

## Installation
You can install `rsahmi` from `CRAN` using:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rsahmi")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from
[r-universe](https://yunuuuu.r-universe.dev/rsahmi) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::repo_add("https://yunuuuu.r-universe.dev")
pak::pak("rsahmi")
```

or from [GitHub](https://github.com/Yunuuuu/rsahmi) with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pak("Yunuuuu/rsahmi")
```

You must also install [kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual).
